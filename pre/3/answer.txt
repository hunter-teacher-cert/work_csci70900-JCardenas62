1. Output:
  "No, I wug. You wugga wug.I wug."
2. Stack diagram first time ping is invoked:
      main: "No, I "
      zoop:
      baffle: "wug"
      ping: "."
  Not sure about the formatting here. 
3. You get a loop by invoking baffle at the end of ping, because
within baffle you also invoke ping. This creates a loop.
