   <td><strong>Topic:</strong> How do we create documentation for others to understand the code we write?
   </td>
   <td><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Students will be able to:
1. Read and interpret code using the rubber-duck method.
2. Write documentation that explains the code for another person.
   </td>
   <td><strong>SIOP</strong>: Content Objective: Students will utilize the rubber-duck debugging method to read and interpret code. They will use this meta-cognitive strategy to write documentation clarifying the code that is written.  

Language Objective: Students will write documentation in proper sentences that will explain the code they are assigned enough for another student to understand.

<p>
<strong>Do-now/Warm-up Activity:</strong> Time: 5 minutes

Students will take their notebooks, copy the Topic, Content and Language Objectives, and answer "What is one subject you can explain in-depth for 10 minutes?"

<p>
<strong>I-Do</strong>: Time: 5 minutes  

I will talk about a story in which I found myself confused about code that I have written. I will then display a rubber duck and explain how the rubber duck helped me to figure out what I had done wrong. I will do a small example with sample code where I practice rubber-ducking the code.
<p>
<strong>We-Do</strong>: Time: 5 minutes

We will watch this short video on rubber-ducking: \
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLClMf6yO-k

I will ask the H.O.T. questions to check for understanding.
<p>
<strong>You-Do:</strong> Time: 30 minutes

Students will be separated in pairs. Each student will have a handout that contains Code A and B, and a rubber duck. Students sitting to the left will be assigned Code A  and the students to the right will be assigned Code B. Students will be given 6 minutes to read the code to themselves. Then the students with Code A will grab the rubber duck and begin explaining line-by-line the logic and code. This student will have 5 minutes to do this for code A. Their partner will write up documentation explaining the purpose of the code, and write up comments throughout the code explaining how it works for another person. They will then switch roles in which the student with Code B will rubber-duck the code and the other student will write up documentation and comments explaining the code based off the student's rubber ducking. We will spend the last 5-8 minutes sharing explanations and offering feedback until the class ends.
<p>
<strong>Exit Slip:</strong> Students will hand in their worksheet at the end of class.
