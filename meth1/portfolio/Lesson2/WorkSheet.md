DIRECTIONS: You will complete this assignment in pairs. The person to the left of the room will be Student A, and the person to the right of the room will be Student B. Write down your names below:

 \
**Student A:**

**Student B:**

Student A you will read Code A. Student B you will read Code B. You will be given 8 minutes to read your assigned code. Try to understand what is going on to the best of your ability. Take notes if you have to on the back of this paper.

**Code A:**

```
public static boolean isDivisible(int n, int m) {

      if (n % m == 0) {

          return true;

      } else {

          return false;

      }

  }
  ```

**Code B:**
```
public static boolean isTriangle (int a, int b, int c){

    if (a >= b + c) {

          return false;

      } else if (b >= a + c) {

    } else if (c >= a + b) {

          return false;

      } else {

        return true;
```
Student A, you will have 5 minutes to grab the Rubber Duck and begin going line-by-line explaining the code and the logic behind it. Student B, you will listen attentively and write down comments, and documentation below. Remember Student B, you must write clearly so that any other person in the room can read your documentation and notes and understand the program.

Now you will switch roles, and Student B you will grab the rubber duck and go line-by-line explaining the code and the logic behind it. Student A, you will listen attentively and write down comments and documentation below. Again, as a reminder Student A, you must write clearly so that any other person in the room can read your documentation and notes and understand the program.

**Code B Documentation:**

**Reflection Questions** (to be done in-class or for HW):

1. What did you think about the rubber-duck technique when you were doing it?
2. Was the rubber-duck technique helpful for you in understanding the code?
3. What would you improve for the next time you have to rubber-duck?
