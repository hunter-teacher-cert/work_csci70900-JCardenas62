   <td><strong>Topic:</strong> How do we collect data and represent it on a bar graph using Java?
   </td>
   <td><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Students will be able to:

1. Collect and record data

2. Read, write and interpret code to input data

3. Identify the elements of an array and its assigned value.
   </td>
   <td><strong>SIOP</strong>: Content Objective: Students will explain what an array is, how to set-up an array, and how to utilize information within an array to make a bar graph.  

Language Objective: Students will define and correctly utilize the terms: element, array, value, data.
   </td>
   <td><strong>Academic Vocabulary:</strong> Array- a group of variables identical in type (integer, string, etc) that are all referred to by a common name.  
Element- The number of variables inside the array. Arrays always start at element 0.  
Value- The information found within the element, can be a integer, character, string, etc.

  <tr>
   <td><strong>H.O.T. Questions:</strong>

   What is an array?

What is an element?

What is a value?

Organize from smallest to largest, an array, element and value.  

How do elements and values differ?

Why is it necessary that an array have an element and a value?

Is the data that we collected a value or an element? Explain why.
</td>
<td><strong>Differentiation</strong>:

Students will be shown images demonstrating the order of array, element, and value.  

Students will have a live demo with boxes that demonstrate the organization of values, elements
and arrays.

Students will have sample code with comments that will help guide students.

   <td><strong>Possible Misconceptions:</strong> An element is the value.
An element starts at 1.
The organization levels between element, value and array.

   <td colspan="2" ><strong>Real-World Connections:</strong> Arrays can be used to store various pieces of similar data/ information. Some applications are found in how contacts are stored in telephones, or how some data is displayed by monitors. They are sequential and organized.

   <td colspan="4" ><strong>Activities</strong>:
<p>
<strong>Do-now/Warm-up Activity:</strong> Time: 3 minutes

Students will take their notebooks out, copy the Topic, Content and Language Objectives (school policy). Students will log into their computers and answer
<p>
<strong>I-Do</strong>: Time: 10 minutes
<p>
I will go through a PowerPoint Presentation in which students will learn about arrays. The lesson will focus on what an array is, why it is useful, and how it is written in Java. Throughout the lesson, the H.O.T. questions will be asked when appropriate.
<p>
<strong>We-Do</strong>: Time: 3 minutes
<p>
I will gather a teacher-version of the bar graph code that has all the components filled in. I will compile and run the program. We make some key observations about the graph it produces. The observations I want to discuss are: the elements involved, the starting point of the elements, and how the graph visually represents data.
<p>
<strong>You-Do:</strong> Time: 20 minutes
<p>
Students will access the bar graph demo code and read through the instructions on their own. Students on the demo code will be asked to fill out sections of missing code. Students will also be asked questions about lines of code. Finally students will have 2 data sets that they will need to graph.
<p>
<strong>We-Do</strong>: Time: 4 minutes
<p>
As a class we will review the worksheet. Students will be cold called randomly by utilizing a random number generator (every desk has a number) to participate.
<p>
Extension Activity:
<p>
1. Insert titles to all of the graphs when they run their programs.
<p>
2. Students will generate their own data by surveying 3 of their classmates. The data they obtain would then be graphed in histogram form.
<p>
<strong>Exit Slip:</strong> Time: 5 minutes
<p>
Students will have a choice of answering one of the following 3 questions. The questions will be displayed on the board. Students will hand in their exit slip on their way out of class.
<ol>

<li>Write down any specific examples or uses you can think of where arrays would be useful. Your answer must be between 2-3 sentences.

<li>Compare and contrast how variables and arrays differ in notation. Your answer must be between 2-3 sentences.

<li>Explain why you would use an array instead of multiple variables for data sets. Your answer must be between 2-3 sentences,
</li>
</ol>
