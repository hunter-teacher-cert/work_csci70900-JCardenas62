This live-code demo will be in reference to 01_lesson where students will
be shown how to set-up integer and string variables, in addition to printing them.

Goals of Live-Code:
  1. Review how to set-up a program
  2. Demonstrate proper integer variable syntax
  3. Demonstrate proper syntax for print and println statements with variables.

live-code demo

public class Variable{                     //For lines 11 and 12 I will ask students to
                                            //guide me writing this code. I will purposefully forget
                                            //the open curly bracket on line 11 and I will come back to it
                                            //when we reach the end of the program and are ready to run.
  public static void main (String[] args){
  int FavoriteNumber = 30;                   //demonstrate how to write a int variables
                                              //utilize student input of favorite FavoriteNumber


  String FavoriteColor = "green";              //Demo writing a String variable with another student's
                                              //favorite color.
                                              //Ask "What purpose does the equal sign serve here?"

System.out.println("My favorite number is " + FavoriteNumber + ".");//let students set up System.out.println()
System.out.println("My favorite color is "+ FavoriteColor + ".");//omit semicolon unless student's bring it up

//first we will run the println to demo the println function.
//then I will comment out the println and do the print() function.

System.out.print("My favorite number is ");
System.out.print(FavoriteNumber);
System.out.print(". ");
System.out.print("My favorite color is ");
System.out.print(FavoriteColor);
System.out.print(". ");

//we will go into a discussion on the differences between print and println. After a brief
//discussion I will run both simultaneously.
    }
  }
