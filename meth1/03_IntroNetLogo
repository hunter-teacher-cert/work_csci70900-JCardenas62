NetLogo Initiation Lesson
  Goal: Students to ease into learning a new programming language; in this case
  NetLogo.
      1.Begin with an introductory video on the various uses of NetLogo applied
        across different fields.
      2. Give students time to explore selected models on NetLogo. These models
        will be simpler models whose code is straightforward.
      3. Students will be asked to choose 3 models in which they will trace the
        NetLogo code.
      4. Students will be asked to share out their tracing of the model they
        chose.
      5. Students will work in trios and will be given chart paper. Each trio
          will be asked to make a venn diagram comparing similarities and
          differences between their native programming language and NetLogo.
      6. Students will hang their chart paper around the classroom in form of a
        gallery walk in which students will be given time to visit 3 groups
        charts. Students will be asked to take notes on new items that they
        learned while visiting these charts.
      7. Group discussion on new things learned from each other during the
        gallery walk.
