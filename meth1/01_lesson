## Lesson objective:
1. SWBAT assign different types of variables and utilize them
in multiple print statements.
2. SWBAT do basic arithmetic with int variables.

### Aim: How do we create and use variables?

### Warm up
time: 10 minutes
During the initial class time students will be entering, turning on computers and
 opening notebooks. Students will need time to copy the aim and complete the
 following do-now:

 Open up the text editor and create a println statement that displays "Today,
 _________, I woke up at _______." Fill in the first blank with today's Date
 and fill in the second blank with the time you woke up today.
 For example: "Today, Tuesday July 13th, I woke up at 06:10AM."
 You may refer to previous code we have done in the past.

### Lesson Content
time: 15 minutes
Begin the lesson with an refresher of information that will be needed for today's
lesson:
        -creating a public class filename
        -creating a public static void main
        -System.out.println() statements
Expand on println on how it prints a string and starts a new line.
Introduce the print () function. Explain the difference between println and print.
Do a live demo where:
        -students aid teacher setting up a program (class and main)
        -aid the teacher in setting up a println statements
        -teacher demonstrates how a print() statement is written

Continue lesson with introduction of what a variable is.
    Variable definition: A symbolic name that stores information.
    Variables may come in different types dependent on the information being stored.
    Variables that contains numeric information are called integer variables.
    Variables that contain text are called string variables.
    Display that different types of variables are labeled differently when
    programming.

Do a live demo where:
        -students aid teacher setting up a program (class and main)
        - demonstrate int variable and String variable.
        - create two print() statements that make reference to these variables.
        -create a println statement that make reference to the same variables.
        -compare differences between println and print()
**Possible misconceptions: Students confuse print and println
                          Demo print and println again (if small number of students
                          create mini group going over the key differences prior
                          to releasing to do lesson activity)

### Lesson Activity
time: 22 minutes
Activity 1: Students will create one int variable and one String variable and
print and println them.
Activity 2: Students will create 2 int variables. They will utilize operators
to multiply, divide, add, and subtract these variables and print them.
Activity 3: Students will create 2 String variables and print() them using a +
operator.
Activity 4: Students will create a program that will display the date in an
American format, and a European format utilizing a combination of print and
println statements.

Examples will be given for all activities to serve as reference for what the
finished product should look like.

### Closing
time: 08 minutes

Students will be asked to create two int Variables and one String variable.
They will then need to println the String variable and the two int variables
with the proper operator.
Students will need to either add, subtract, multiple, or divide the int Variables.
